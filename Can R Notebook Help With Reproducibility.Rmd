**Introduction**

What is reproducibility? In science it's by some considered to be the holy grail of statistics. Basically it means doing an experiment or research multiple times by different people or groups, with the same numbers and get the same result.

One of the big challenges of (statistical?/Data?) science has been to reproduce the identical results from an earlier research. In a significant amount of research it has proved hard or flat out impossible to reproduce the results from other peoples and older research for a multitude of reasons. One of the big reason is quite simply that the data used in the research is unobtainable, due to them being "too old" or lost. Another reason is the author doesn't want to share the data or can't find it (again, lost). Other challenges is the usage of different systems, equipment, and so on. Theories around the research and calculations can also change over time.

In more modern times a new idea around this have been brought up: computable documents. The idea behind this is when publishing a research paper, one submits the data, equations and calculations together with a document that's computable. That way when other researches wants to run the experiment, they have access to everything, and can see what others did before them. So the question then becomes: can computable documents like R Notebook help with reproducibility?
