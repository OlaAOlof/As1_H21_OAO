# Introduction
In this document we will look at reproducibility and the importance of it.
In this context, we will address the topic of using "R Notebook" in RStudio.

We'll look into theory regarding reproducibility and R Notebook, which we will also link to an analysis.

## What is reproducibility?

In science it's by some considered to be the holy grail of statistics. Basically it means doing an experiment or research multiple times by different people or groups, with the same numbers and get the same result.

* Kevin:

This is desirable because it is important that the findings are robust, trustworthy, and conducted in a satisfactory way.
Reproducibility is one important approach that scientists use to gain confidence in their conclusions (McNutt, 2014). How confident in a conclusion would one be if the scientist could not reproduce the result and conclude similarly again? She states that this confidence is important regarding the broad scientific community. This is due to the scientifical knowledge is public in a special sense. It does not only exist in the mind of the particular researcher, but one could argue that the knowledge does not exist until it has been submitted to the scientific community for criticism and empirical testing (Stanovich, 2014). He elucidates this matter by introducing the term replication. The term is understood to mean that a finding must be presented to the scientific community in a way that allows fellow scientists to re-do the study and achieve the same results.
	Researchers often use the terms replicability and reproducibility interchangeably, but it is useful to distinguish between them. Replicability is “re-performing the experiment and collecting new data,” whereas reproducibility is “re-performing the same analysis with the same code using a different analyst” (Patil et al., 2016). According to Stanovich (2014), one of the most important criteria for scientists is that the findings are presented in a way that they can be replicated, exposed for criticism, or extended further on. This is due to the same reason reproducibility is important – as mentioned initially.


## Challenges

One of the big challenges of (statistical?/Data?) science has been to reproduce the identical results from an earlier research. In a significant amount of research it has proved hard or flat out impossible to reproduce the results from other peoples and older research for a multitude of reasons. One of the big reason is quite simply that the data used in the research is unobtainable, due to them being "too old" or lost. Another reason is the author doesn't want to share the data or can't find it (again, lost). Other challenges is the usage of different systems, equipment, and so on. Theories around the research and calculations can also change over time.

## Computable Documents

In more modern times a new idea around this have been brought up: computable documents. The idea behind this is when publishing a research paper, one submits the data, equations and calculations together with a document that's computable. That way when other researches wants to run the experiment, they have access to everything, and can see what others did before them. So the question then becomes: can computable documents like R Notebook help with reproducibility?

# Discussion

Why is reproducibilty important? What are the issues surrounding it? What steps have been taken to improve the situation? What does scientist say about it?

# Conclusion

Help? Yes, to a degree. Solve/Fix the problem? No, atleast not yet. Too many issues. Different systems, different OS, different software and packages. Theories and calculations can change over time. Packages being updated/outdated. R have "Session Info" to list systems, maybe a library of packages would help? It's seems to be a step in the right direction, but it still remains issues around reproducibility even with the help of computable documents like R Notebook.
