It presents the findings of a two-year study that collected programs and data from authors and attempted to replicate their published results. Our research provides new and important information about the extent and causes of failures to replicate published results in economics. Our findings suggest that inadvertent errors in published empirical articles are a commonplace rather thana rare occurrence.}

  abstract = {This report provides an overview on access to and preservation of scientific information in the EU Member States as well as Norway and Turkey. Concerning open access to scientific peer-reviewed publications, most EU Member States reported a national preference for one or the other type of open access to publications, that is, either the Green or the Gold model. However, the expressed preferences for one or the other model are not pure models whereby only one route is followed. Overall, policies on open access to research data are less developed across EU countries than policies and strategies on open access to research publications. However, individual Member State feedback shows a general acknowledgement of the importance of open research data and of policies. As concerns the curation and preservation of scientific information, institutional repositories are very well developed in most Member States, although certification is sometimes lacking. Concerning participation in multi-stakeholder dialogues and activities, several countries have set up national coordination bodies or networks. Others rely on a university or a university library (or an association of libraries), their Research Promotion Agency/Research Councils or their Academy of Science. Specific events or dedicated EU fora and/or projects have also been identified as a way to galvanize stakeholder interaction.},

  abstract = {The current system of publication in biomedical research provides a distorted view of the reality of scientific data that are generated in the laboratory and clinic. This system can be studied by applying principles from the field of economics. The ``winner's curse,'' a more general statement of publication bias, suggests that the small proportion of results chosen for publication are unrepresentative of scientists' repeated samplings of the real world. The self-correcting mechanism in science is retarded by the extreme imbalance between the abundance of supply (the output of basic science laboratories and clinical investigations) and the increasingly limited venues for publication (journals with sufficiently high impact). This system would be expected intrinsically to lead to the misallocation of resources. The scarcity of available outlets is artificial, based on the costs of printing in an electronic age and a belief that selectivity is equivalent to quality. Science is subject to great uncertainty: we cannot be confident now which efforts will ultimately yield worthwhile achievements. However, the current system abdicates to a small number of intermediates an authoritative prescience to anticipate a highly unpredictable future. In considering society's expectations and our own goals as scientists, we believe that there is a moral imperative to reconsider how scientific data are judged and disseminated.},
